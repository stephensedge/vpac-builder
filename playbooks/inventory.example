# Copy this file to 'inventory' if you prefer using an inventory file
# instead of passing '-i localhost, --connection=local' on every command:
#
#   cp inventory.example inventory
#
# Then run playbooks with:
#   ansible-playbook playbooks/<playbook>.yml -i playbooks/inventory --become --ask-become-pass
#
# inventory is gitignored and will not be committed.
